    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>I am using this blog to document my GSoC 2018 project. I will attempt to provide as much concise useful information as I can to convey my experiences and accomplishments during the 3 month program. I hope other novice developers learn something useful this blog.</p>

    <p> I assume that the reader had a basic introduction into algorithms and graph theory
    to understand the terminology. If not, web searches should be sufficient.

    To understand the code snippets provided, the reader needs to be familiar with Julia's basic syntax, the LightGraphs package and Julia's parallel functionality. Note that the code snippets
    will usually not be the exact code I wrote but will sufficiently (and more concisely) convey my contributions. The exact code will be available in the branches of my <a href="https://github.com/SohamTamba/LightGraphs.jl">cloned LightGraphs repository</a>. Eg. a shortest path algorithm is used to retrieve the minimum distance between the two points as well as the parent relation. I may not include the lines of code related to retrieving the parent relation in case it is trivial.
