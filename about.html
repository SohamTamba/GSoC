    <h1>Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Soham Tamba. I graduated from National Institute of Technolgy (Goa, India) in 2018 with a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have spent a large amount of my time in the undergrad program studying algorithms and optimisation. Most of my experience in coding resides in <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/Soham_Tamba">competitive coding</a>. I am aspiring to be a researcher that develops the theory behind solutions to problems of significance in computer science. I chose to participate in GSoC to obtain some practical experience in a High Performance Computing project.

    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>I am using this blog to document my GSoC 2018 project. I will attempt to provide as much useful information as possible to convey my experiences and accomplishments during the 3 month program. I hope other novice developers learn something useful this blog. I assume that the reader has had a basic introduction into algorithms and graph theory.</p>
